                        Following the destruction of Ansem and Xemnas at the hands of Sora and Riku, Xehanort is revived. In response, Yen Sid puts Sora and Riku through a Mark of Mastery exam in order for them to become full-fledged Keyblade Masters and counter the coming return of Master Xehanort. As part of this trial, the two are separated from each other and sent to worlds previously destroyed by the Heartless that have since been restored, though now in a state of "deep sleep" which disconnects them from the other worlds. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These seven worlds are plagued by Dream Eaters — creatures born from darkness that seek out the sleeping worlds' Keyholes. Sora and Riku's given task is to reawaken the sleeping worlds by unlocking the seven Keyholes they find there and then return to the realm of light, recruiting benevolent "Spirit" Dream Eaters to guide them and battle the malevolent "Nightmare" Dream Eaters, after which they will be deemed Keyblade Masters.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        During the exam, Sora and Riku cross paths with the resurrected "Ansem" and Xemnas, as well as a younger incarnation of Master Xehanort from an alternate past. The three bring Sora to the World That Never Was, where he learns of Organization XIII's true purpose—to serve as vessels for Master Xehanort to place pieces of his heart inside, thereby transforming them into clones of Xehanort. Sora is forced into a comatose state by the young Xehanort and his heart is swallowed by darkness, though it is protected by Ventus's suit of armor residing within him. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Riku goes to rescue Sora, only to be confronted by the young Xehanort, who unveils a new Organization XIII composed of the newly revived Master Xehanort and his eleven vessels, whom Xehanort plans to pit against seven Keyblade wielders and recreate the χ-blade. Master Xehanort tries to turn Sora into his last needed vessel, but Sora is rescued by Riku, Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Lea—the revived human form of the original Organization's Axel—after which Xehanort and his other vessels retreat. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sora's body is brought back to Yen Sid's tower, where Riku enters his body and releases Sora's heart from Ventus' armor, now possessed by a Nightmare. After Sora reawakens, only Riku is declared a Keyblade Master by Yen Sid, and Lea reveals himself to have become a Keyblade wielder. Undaunted by his failure, Sora embarks on a new journey by himself to train. While Sora travels to Traverse Town in order to meet all his Dream Eater friends, Ventus is shown still being at Castle Oblivion, but suddenly starts smiling a bit.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The unlockable secret ending for Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is comprised of three scenes. In the first scene, Young Xehanort is seen standing alone on the beach in Destiny Islands. The second shows Aqua staring into the distance at the Dark Margin whilst smiling.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the final segment, Donald and Goofy sit outside the Mysterious Tower and are met by Riku and a visitor whom they had not expected. Inside the tower, Yen Sid outlines to Mickey the history of the Keyblade War and the χ-blade, and the two speak about the seven lights, the Princesses of Heart. Yen Sid explains that there is no avoiding the gathering of the seven guardians of light to protect the seven pure lights, and thus a clash with the thirteen seekers of darkness is inevitable. Mickey arrives at the conclusion that only one more guardian of light is required to complete the total. At this point, Riku enters the tower with Kairi close behind.
